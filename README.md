Features
When the program first starts the users can login into the main screen or terminate the program. There are two main options logout, which will return the user back to the login part of the program and a hack feature. The hack feature will "hack" into a random computer and display some personal information and emails. If you hack to quickly one after the other your cpu usage might overload. If it does the program will crash and a blue screen of death will be displayed. Although be carefulk when hacking! There is another hacker out there "Mr Robot". If you hack him he will inject your system with a virus and the program will crash.

Visual features
My favorite visual feature in this is the falling matrix code which is a stream of random characters that will be raining down in the background of the program. When you hack a computer a loading bar will be displayed and the current percentage will be displayed. Another cool feature is the cpu usage bar will change color depending on the precentage it is on.
